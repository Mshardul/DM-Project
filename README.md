# DM-Project

Working on the storage of Temporal Data.

Notes :-
. table stored as <dbName_tableName>.
. sqlite has no concept of date datatype, using text here.
. tables are created using direct db access, rather than dynamic models.
. not using information schema as of now (will see if required)

To Do :-
. not implementing key concepts(pk and fk) as of now (not sure, if it is required)
. data types options are still static.
. "get rel" button is not working yet
